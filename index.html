  <h2>Step 1: Income Mindset</h2>
  <p>
    Understand how money really works<br>
    and why most people stay broke.
    <br><br>

    Most people are not broke because they don’t work hard.<br>
    They stay broke because they trade time for money<br>
    without building skills or systems.
    <br><br>

    Money flows to:<br>
    • Skills that solve real problems<br>
    • Systems that work repeatedly<br>
    • People who control value, not just effort
    <br><br>

    Being busy is not the same as building income.
    <br><br>

    The real goal is to move from earning money<br>
    to creating value.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Go Deeper:</strong><br>
    Read the full breakdown on how money actually works<br>
    and why the hard-working stay broke.<br>

    <br><br>

    <strong>Today’s Action:</strong><br>
    Write down one way you currently earn money.<br>
    Then write one skill you could learn<br>
    that pays better long-term.
  </p>
</div>
    
<div class="card">
  <h2>Step 2: Pick ONE Income Skill</h2>
  <p>
    Stop chasing everything.<br>
    Focus creates income.
    <br><br>

    Most people fail online<br>
    not because opportunities don’t work,<br>
    but because they try too many things at once.
    <br><br>

    One skill done well<br>
    beats ten skills done poorly.
    <br><br>

    A real income skill:<br>
    • People already pay for it<br>
    • Solves a clear problem<br>
    • Improves with practice
    <br><br>

    You don’t need passion.<br>
    You need demand.
    <br><br>

    <strong>Go Deeper:</strong><br>
    Read how focus creates income<br>
    and how to choose the right skill.<br>
